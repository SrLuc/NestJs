# Setup

In a NestJS project, there are several folders and files organized in a specific way. Basically, the project is divided into three main folders:

- **ROOT**: Contains NestJS configurations and other folders like `src` and `test`.
- **SRC**: Contains the main code of the project.
- **TEST**: Contains test scripts for the project's functions.

## Cleaning the Default Setup

After creating a new NestJS project, some default configurations need to be removed.

### Steps to clean up:

- Delete the `app.controller.spec.ts` file.
- Delete the `app.controller.ts` file.
- Delete the `app.service.ts` file.
- Remove the imports of these files in `app.module.ts`.

## app.module.ts

The `app.module.ts` file is the **main module** of the project and is responsible for importing other modules.

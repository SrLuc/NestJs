# 2 Step

On Nestjs project we have some folders and files.

In additon, basically, nestjs project are divided in threes especifically folders:
- ROOT : has nest configs and others folders like src and test
- SRC : has de main code of the project
- TEST : has codes to test functions about the project

## Cleaning the default setup

So, its need clean some defaults configs when create a new nest projects.

- Delete app.controller.spec
- Delete app.controller.ts
- Delete app.services.ts
- Clean imported files on app.module

### App.module.ts
It's the main module that import other modules
